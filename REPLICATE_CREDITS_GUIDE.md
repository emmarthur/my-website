# Replicate Credits Guide

## The Issue

All Replicate models (including Flux Schnell) require credits to run. Even though Flux Schnell is very cheap, you still need to add credits to your account.

## How to Add Credits

### Step 1: Go to Billing Page
Visit: https://replicate.com/account/billing

### Step 2: Add Credits
- Minimum: $5 (but this gives you ~1,600 images with Flux Schnell!)
- Flux Schnell costs: **~$0.003 per image** (very affordable)
- Flux Pro costs: **~$0.04 per image** (premium quality)

### Step 3: Wait
After adding credits, wait 2-3 minutes for them to be processed.

### Step 4: Try Again
Go back to your website and try generating an image again!

## Free Credits

Replicate sometimes offers:
- **Free credits for new accounts** - Check your account dashboard
- **Promotional credits** - Watch for announcements
- **Trial credits** - May be available when you first sign up

## Cost Comparison

| Model | Cost per Image | Quality | Speed |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Flux Schnell | ~$0.003 | Good | Fast (2-5 sec) |
| Flux Pro | ~$0.04 | Excellent | Medium (10-30 sec) |
| Stable Diffusion | ~$0.002 | Good | Medium |

**Example**: With $5, you can generate:
- **~1,600 images** with Flux Schnell
- **~125 images** with Flux Pro
- **~2,500 images** with Stable Diffusion

## Alternative: Free AI Image Services

If you want completely free options:

### 1. Hugging Face Inference API
- Some models are free
- Requires Hugging Face account
- Rate limits apply

### 2. Stability AI (Free Tier)
- Limited free requests
- Requires account setup

### 3. Local Generation
- Run models on your own computer
- Completely free but requires powerful GPU

## Recommendation

**Flux Schnell is the best value** - it's very cheap ($0.003/image) and produces good quality images quickly. Adding $5-10 gives you plenty of images to experiment with!
