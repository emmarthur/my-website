EXPERIENCE
Blackrock- Analyst, Aladdin Engineering, Observability Wilmington, DE May 2024 - July 2025
● ServiceNow AI Inventory (January 2025 - March 2025): Partnered with compliance and AI teams to
architect a ServiceNow-based AI inventory system with custom data models and import automation.
Leveraged Agile boards to manage tasks, tested client scripts/UI Policies, and deployed iteratively in sync
with ServiceNow SDLC workflows. Now all data inventory for AI business applications within the company
are stored and managed within this system
● Filename Encoder App (August 2024-September 2024): Co-developed a production-grade Python tool
with Private Markets engineers to URL-encode filenames for secure internal file transfers; followed Agile
sprints, wrote unit tests, and deployed via CI/CD pipelines. This allowed private markets team members to
easily access market data without the bottleneck of incorrect filename formats.
● CPAdmin Page Enhancement (September 2024-December 2024): Worked cross-functionally with
platform and frontend teams to redesign CPAdmin using JSBootstrap and Java; enabled configuration
edits for Kubernetes assignments in Aladdin apps. Integrated unit tests across frontend and backend
logic, aligning with SDLC checkpoints in Agile sprints. This enabled all developers throughout the company
to configure data for running applications and scripts on servers deployed on Kubernetes.
● CUSIP Fund Retriever (June 2024-August 2024): Built a Python + SQL reporting tool during onboarding
to retrieve CUSIP fund data and auto-distribute reports via email. Collaborated with mentors for feedback,
applied script-level unit testing, and completed the full SDLC cycle from requirement to deployment in a
Aladdin Developer training environment.
