PROJECTS
Business Impact Simulator application Ongoing, multi-phase project
● Building an AI-powered application that first classifies a project into the appropriate industry area(s) based
on its descriptions, papers, and documents, then uses analytical and intelligence-based tools to generate
both textual and graphical narratives of the project’s impact on real or hypothetical companies, including
long-term, industry-level effects. The current version of this project is available on GitHub under the name
“Business Impact Simulator.”
Business Impact Simulator application (Retail) Expected completion: December 2025
● Will soon build a small subset of the larger business impact simulator project as a final MVP project for my
ongoing Internet, Web and Cloud systems class. This will focus on projects in the field of retail and use
various backend APIs to generate their simulated impact on a fictitious/real business entity and the field of
retail at large in the long term.
WORK EXPERIENCE
BlackRock —Analyst, Aladdin Engineering & Tech Support Wilmington, DE May 2023 - July 2025
